        I am an artist, and I created some NFTs to showcase my work.
        Unfortunately, they didn’t sell well, and I was stuck with them.
        I was also paying a lot of taxes on my other income sources, and
        I was looking for a way to reduce them. That’s when I discovered
        BAD NFT, and I was blown away by the concept. I sold my NFTs on
        BAD NFT, and I got a tax receipt that I used to lower my taxable
        income. I saved a lot of money on taxes and cleared my wallet.
        Total win–win!

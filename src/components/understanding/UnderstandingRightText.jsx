        Of course, every tax situation is different, and you should consult with a tax professional before using this service. BAD NFT is not a tax advisor, and does not provide individual tax advice. However, they do work with the tax professionals at TaxBit, who can help you craft your tax strategy, unlock deductions, and keep your taxes clear and legitimate. You can learn more about their 30-minute consultation service on their website.
